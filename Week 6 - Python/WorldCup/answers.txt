Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Overall, predictions weren't great, France didn't win in any of them and Brazil performed much better than in reality.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would argue predictions didn't really fail due to the amount of iterations simulated but because the simulating logic itself relies
on a simplistic and not too well-thought ranking system, so 100000 simulations might do the trick.
