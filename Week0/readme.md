# Problem Set 0: Scratch

## Problem Description

Make a program in scratch with the following specifications:
- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game.

## My solution

### Description

A laser-shooting spaceship that blows meteors to protect its home-planet; The spaceship moves horizontally while meteors come its way.

### Rules
