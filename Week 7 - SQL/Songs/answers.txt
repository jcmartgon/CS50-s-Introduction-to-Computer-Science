Lab 7: Songs

1) List the names of all songs in the database:
SELECT name FROM songs;

2) List the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo:
SELECT name FROM songs ORDER BY tempo;

3) List the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length:
SELECT name FROM songs ORDER BY duration_ms  DESC LIMIT 5;

4) Lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75:
SELECT name FROM songs WHERE danceability > 0.75 AND energy > 0.75 AND valence > 0.75;

5) Average energy of all the songs:
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;

6) Lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone:
SELECT name FROM songs WHERE artist_id IN (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name LIKE "Post Malone");

7) Average energy of songs that are by Drake:
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs WHERE artist_id IN (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name LIKE "Drake");

8) Lists the names of the songs that feature other artists:
SELECT name FROM songs WHERE name LIKE "%feat%";

9) If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
One way would be to figure out some clusters of songs by their energy, variance and danceability, and pick the two most prominent out of them.

10) Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
It could be possible to reach a better outcome by taking into account other data such as how long they listen to each type of music, how often they skip,
the time of the day they listen to something, etc.
